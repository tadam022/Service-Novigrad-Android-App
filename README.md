This application is an appointment booking and scheduling software for the fictional 'Service Novigrad', which was designed to provide basic functionality for services similar to that of Service Ontario or Service Quebec. The services include booking appointments for a Drivers License, Health Card and Photo ID. Customers can register for and login to accounts upon which they can search for a Service Novigrad branch by address / service / working hours. After finding one they can book an appointment, and fill out a form and any other required documents. They can then also rate the service. Branch Employees can login to the app to access their own portal where they can create their branch's profile and assign it the services offered and change working hours.

Written in Java and built in Android Studio. Uses Google Firebase for database support.

Note that this was built for a school project, and the database is no longer accessible as it was removed after the course concluded.
